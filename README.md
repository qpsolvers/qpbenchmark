# QP solvers benchmark

[![Contributing](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-green.svg)](https://github.com/stephane-caron/qpsolvers_benchmark/tree/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

Benchmark for quadratic programming (QP) solvers available in Python.

The goal of this benchmark is to help us compare and select QP solvers. Its methodology is open to [discussions](https://github.com/stephane-caron/qpsolvers_benchmark/discussions). New test sets are [also welcome](CONTRIBUTING.md). Feel free to add one that better represents the kind of problems you are working on.

## Metrics

We evaluate QP solvers based on the following metrics:

- **Success rate:** percentage of problems a solver is able to solve on a given test set.
- **Computation time:** time a solver takes to solve a given problem.
- **Primal residual:** maximum error on equality and inequality constraints at the returned solution.
- **Dual residual:** maximum error on the dual feasibility condition at the returned solution.
- **Duality gap:** value of the duality gap at the returned solution.
- **Cost error:** difference between the solution cost and the known optimal cost.

If you are wondering about the meaning of residuals or the duality gap, check out for instance [Optimality conditions and numerical tolerances in QP solvers](https://scaron.info/blog/optimality-conditions-and-numerical-tolerances-in-qp-solvers.html).

### Shifted geometric mean

Each metric (computation time, primal and dual residuals, duality gap) produces a different ranking of solvers for each problem. To aggregate those rankings into a single metric over the whole test set, we use the *shifted geometric mean* (shm), which is a standard to aggregate computation times in [benchmarks for optimization software](#other-benchmarks). This mean has the advantage of being compromised by neither large outliers (as opposed to the arithmetic mean) nor by small outliers (in contrast to the geometric geometric mean). Check out the [references](#references) below for further details.

Here are some intuitive interpretations:

- A solver with a shifted-geometric-mean runtime of $Y$ is $Y$ times slower than the best solver over the test set.
- A solver with a shifted-geometric-mean primal residual $R$ is $R$ times less accurate on equality and inequality constraints than the best solver over the test set.

## Limitations

Here are some known areas of improvement for this benchmark:

- *Cold start only:* we don't evaluate warm-start performance for now.

Check out the [issue tracker](https://github.com/stephane-caron/qpsolvers_benchmark/issues) for ongoing works and future improvements.

## Installation

Install all required dependencies by:

```console
pip install qpsolvers_benchmark
```

By default, the benchmark will run with any supported solver installed on your system. You can install all supported open-source solvers at once by installing ``qpsolvers_benchmark[open_source_solvers]``, *i.e.* appending the ``open_source_solvers`` dependency.

## Running the benchmark

Pick up the keyword corresponding to the desired [test set](#test-sets), for instance ``maros_meszaros``, and pass it to the ``run`` command:

```console
python benchmark.py maros_meszaros run
```

You can also run a specific solver, problem or set of solver settings:

```console
python benchmark.py maros_meszaros_dense run --solver proxqp --settings default
```

Check out ``python benchmark.py --help`` for all available commands and arguments.

## Contributing

Contributions to improving this benchmark are welcome. You can for instance propose new problems, or share the runtimes you obtain on your machine. Check out the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.
