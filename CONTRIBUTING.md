# 👷 Contributing

This project's goal is to facilitate the comparison of quadratic programming solvers for the community of solver users. All contributions are welcome, for example here are some ways to help:

- [Submit a new problem](https://github.com/stephane-caron/qpsolvers_benchmark/issues/new?template=new_problem.md) that better reflects the kind of problems you are working on.
- Run an existing test set on your machine, and share your results (both CSV data and Markdown report) in the corresponding [``results``](https://github.com/stephane-caron/qpsolvers_benchmark/tree/main/results)/``test_set`` subdirectory.
