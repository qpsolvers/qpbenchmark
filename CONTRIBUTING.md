# 👷 Contributing

This project's goal is to facilitate the comparison of quadratic programming solvers for the community of solver users. All contributions are welcome, for example here are some ways to help:

- [Submit a new problem](https://github.com/stephane-caron/qpsolvers_benchmark/issues/new?template=new_problem.md), *e.g.* one that reflects the applications you are working on.
- Create a new test set, distribute it in its own repository, and open a PR to reference it here
